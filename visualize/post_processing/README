POST-PROCESSING CONSISTS OF 2 PARTS:

a) Normalization
b) Pattern Match

A) NORMALIZATION

Once we have the taint trace, we normalize the backtrace for each of the blocks.

1. extract the block number and the block number taint

2. find backtrace for each of the block number taints (use ./visualize/trace.py -b <block_nr_taint_number>)

3. normalize the backtrace:
	Compaction:
	a) remove redundant assignments - O[][][][] = O[][][][]
	b) remove [][][][] which are constants and do not lead to blocks

4. End result of normalization should be

	BLOCK DESTINATION
	add something1 something2
	something1 = div something3 something4
	something3 = constant something5
	something4 = constant something6
	something2 = BLOCK SOURCE 
	BLOCK SOURCE

where something* is a variable

B) PATTERN MATCH


C) RESULTS:

Without Normalization: I get http://moss.stanford.edu/results/38307664/ which does not give us much similarity in terms of number of lines copied
