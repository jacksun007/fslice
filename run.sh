# it extracts the bitcode section from the given ELF or MACH-O object and reassembles it to an actual bitcode file.

# opt = optimize 
# info about all these options were obtained by using the following command:
# opt -load=libFSlice.so -help
#
#
# load = load the dynamic object plugin, which is libFSlice.so
# opt -load=libFSlice.so -help gives the following info regarding the options used.
# constprop - simple constant propagation
# ssa - single static assignment form - every variable is assigned only once.
#					multiple assignment of variables leads to giving version numbers
# sccp - sparse conditional constant propagation
# sccp - removing dead code and doing constant propagation in ssa form of code
#
# scalarrepl - Scalar Replacement of Aggregates - SSAUp
# eleminating all enums and complicated structures by treating each variables separately. see fruit example here:

# mergereturn - Unify Function Exit Nodes
# ensure that functions have atmost one exit function in them.

# sink - Code Sinking
# moves instructions to successor blocks, when possible, so that they are not executed on paths where there results are not needed

# licm - Loop Invariant Code motion
# move code inside loop outside the loop without changing function semantics 

# mem2reg - Promote Memory to register
# 

# fslice - File system runtime program slicing pass
